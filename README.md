# Command Line Client for Bird's Eye - A Bird API

This is a simple command line client for Bird's Eye written in python. It produces output formats intended for both humans *and* scripts.
This is a project of the RIPE IXP Tools Hackaton just prior to RIPE73 in Madrid, Spain.
Because the auther is not really fluent in python and the time was limited his has not become great python but rather a "perl script written in python".

## Documentation

'beye -h' for now

## Installation

A stand-alone script. Major dependencies: (requests, tabulate).

If someone else has time to properly package it the python way, be my guest!
